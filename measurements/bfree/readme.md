In order to run the BFree measurements, BFree has to be modified to allow access to SWD. Per default the SWD pins are used as GPIO, in both Micropython as the bootloader. 

Both a modified version of BFree and the bootloader is provided in the software folder. Logs and settings of the BFree measurements can be found in their respective folders.
