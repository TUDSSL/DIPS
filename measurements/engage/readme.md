For this example we used an unmodified version of the Battery-free Game Boy source code from (https://github.com/TUDSSL/ENGAGE)

From the ENGAGE folder:

```
cd software/build/
cmake ../
make -j12
```

The emulator binary was then flashed to ENGAGE and a game was loaded prior to starting the measurements. Logs and settings of the ENGAGE measurements can be found in their respective folders.
